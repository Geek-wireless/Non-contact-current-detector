# Non-contact current detector

The current detection system measures the peak and peak value of ac current signal in a non-contact way, the peak and peak value of frequency and each harmonic component, the peak and peak value range is 10ma-1a, and the frequency range of fundamental wave is 100hz-1000hz. The system is divided into two parts, one is the power amplifier circuit, which performs power amplification on the voltage signal added on the 10-ohm resistor and converts the voltage signal to the current signal. The second part is the current signal detection, through three core group of manganese copper coil turns to realize non-contact current signal detection, coil measured signal after 1 KHZ low-pass filter to eliminate waveform burr after AD603 control gain, finally divided into two road, all the way through the MCU AD sampling current signal of fengfeng value, all the way through the voltage comparator plastic for the rectangular wave.The wave is measured by STM32 MCU to its AD sampling.finally conduct FFT to calculate every harmonic size, income data after integrated display.
